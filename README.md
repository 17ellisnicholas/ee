HTML5 Bombergirl
================
HTML5 game written in JavaScript with help of [EaselJS](https://github.com/CreateJS/EaselJS) library. I've chosen this library because it is supported by Adobe and Microsoft and even Google has used it while creating [Find your way to Oz](http://www.findyourwaytooz.com/) Chrome experiment.

Developed after participating in [HTML5 Game Development (CS255)](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs255) online class on [Udacity.com](http://udacity.com).
